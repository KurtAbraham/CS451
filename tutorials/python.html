    <h1>Python Tutorial</h1>
    <hr>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Python is a powerful and versatile programming language known for its simplicity and readability. This tutorial will introduce you to the fundamental concepts of Python, allowing you to begin writing basic programs.</p>

    <h2>Setting Up</h2>
    <p>To start coding in Python, you'll need to install the Python interpreter. Download and install it from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/.</p>

    <h2>Hello, World!</h2>
    <p>Let's begin with the classic "Hello, World!" program. This simple program prints the message "Hello, World!" to the console.</p>
    <pre>
    <code>python
        print("Hello, World!")
        </code>
    </pre>
    <p>Save this code as a file with a `.py` extension (e.g., hello.py) and run it using the Python interpreter. You should see the message displayed on the console.</p>

    <h2>Variables</h2>
    <p>Variables are used to store data in your programs. You can assign values to variables using the assignment operator (`=`).</p>
    <pre>
    <code>python
        name = "Alice"
        age = 30

        print("My name is", name, "and I am", age, "years old.")
        </code>
    </pre>
    <p>In this example, we define two variables: `name` and `age`. We then use them in the `print` statement to display their values.</p>

    <h2>Data Types</h2>
    <p>Python supports various data types, such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>**Strings:** Text data enclosed in quotes (single or double)</li>
        <li>**Integers:** Whole numbers (e.g., 10, -5)</li>
        <li>**Floats:** Numbers with decimal points (e.g., 3.14, -2.5)</li>
        <li>**Booleans:** True or False values</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Comments</h2>
    <p>Comments are lines of code ignored by the interpreter but serve as explanations for human readers. Use the `#` symbol to add comments.</p>
    <pre>
    <code>python
        # This is a comment
        print("This line will be executed")
        </code>
    </pre>

    <h2>Operators</h2>
    <p>Python provides various operators for performing calculations and comparisons:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>**Arithmetic operators:** `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%` (modulo)</li>
        <li>**Comparison operators:** `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`</li>
        <li>**Logical operators:** `and`, `or`, `not`</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Control Flow</h2>
    <p>Control flow statements allow you to control the execution order of your program.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>**`if` statements:** Execute code conditionally based on a boolean expression.</li>
        <li>**`for` loops:** Repeatedly execute a block of code for a certain number of times.</li>
        <li>**`while` loops:** Repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a condition is true.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Functions</h2>
    <p>Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks. You can define and call functions to organize your code and improve readability.</p>

    <h2>Further Learning</h2>
    <p>This is just a brief introduction to Python. As you progress, you can explore more complex concepts and utilize various libraries and frameworks to build powerful applications. Visit the official Python documentation for in-depth information: https://docs.python.org/.</p>
